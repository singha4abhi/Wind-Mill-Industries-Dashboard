# CASE STUDY
# Client Background: 
Our client is a renewable energy company operating wind turbines across multiple sites. With an expanding portfolio, the client sought to harness data-driven insights to ensure optimal turbine performance, minimize losses during power generation, and evaluate the impact of various factors such as wind speed and manufacturer quality.
# Challenges: 
The client faced significant challenges in the following areas:

**Performance Monitoring**

Difficulty in tracking the operational performance of individual wind turbines across multiple locations.
Lack of centralized dashboards to monitor real-time and historical performance data.

**Efficiency Analysis**

Inability to determine if turbines were operating at optimal efficiency levels.
Uncertainty about losses during the generation process and their causes.

**Manufacturer Comparison**

No clear insights into which turbine manufacturers were delivering better performance and reliability.

**Impact of Wind Speeds**

Limited understanding of how fluctuations in wind speed were affecting power generation across sites.
# Solution
To address these challenges, the following data-driven strategies were implemented:

**Centralized Performance Dashboard**
Integration of IoT Sensors: Installed IoT devices on turbines to collect real-time data such as energy output, operating conditions, and downtimes.
